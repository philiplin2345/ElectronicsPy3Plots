# ElectronicsPy3Plots

Interactive Python visualizations for understanding fundamental electronics concepts.

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts that generate interactive diagrams and visualizations to help students, hobbyists, and engineers gain a deeper understanding of core electronics principles. Each script provides hands-on exploration of circuit behavior through dynamic plots and real-time parameter adjustments.

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependencies**:
- matplotlib >= 3.5.0
- numpy >= 1.21.0
- scipy >= 1.7.0

## Modules

### 1. [Common Emitter Amplifier](commonEmmiter/)
Interactive analyzer for common emitter BJT amplifier circuits with frequency response visualization.

### 2. [Thevenin Theorem Applications](thevenin/)
Demonstrations of Thevenin's theorem, clamper circuits, and maximum power transfer.

### 3. [Catalan Number Visualization](catalanNumberVisualization/)
Mathematical visualizations of Catalan number sequences.

## Usage

Each module contains its own README with detailed information. Navigate to the module directory and run the Python scripts:

```bash
# Example: Run the common emitter analyzer
python commonEmmiter/ce_analyzer.py
```
